## University

### Computing BSc @ Birkbeck

Graduated in 2020, the course has helped me understand a lot of the history and fundamentals of computing technologies and has  given me a broader understanding of the industry. My time at Birkbeck  taught me to be a better developer and understanding more of what underpin the technology I use on a daily basis.

Here is a subset of the modules I've found most interesting:

- Software Programming.
- Algorithm Design.
- Computer organization and system architecture
- Machine learning concepts. 

### Languages

Python, Go, Bash, PromQL, JavaScript, Powershell
