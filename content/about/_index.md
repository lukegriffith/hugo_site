## University

### Computing BSc @ Birckbeck
Expected graduation is 2020, the course has helped me understand a lot of the history and fundementals of computing technologies, but has also given me a broader understanding of the industry. My time at Birckbeck so far has taught me to be a better developer, understanding more of the terminology and concepts that underpin the technology I use on a daily basis.

Here is a subset of the modules I've found most interesting:

- Software Programming.
- Algorithm Design.
- Information Systems Concepts & Management.
