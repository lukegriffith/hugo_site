Automation to me feels like the guy from Jurassic Park, the first movie - the programmer dude whos meant to be super obnoxious and creates the entire automation for the whole park, only problem is. When he gets eaten by the raptor the entire system is stuck without his access keys. 

They're stuck on an island with dinosaurs wandering around with no doors working and all the lights are off that is not a place you want to be in. DevOps is the transposed oposite, while still maintaining the dude who can create a park that can contain dinosaurs they also spread the knowledge by talking about what they've made in hope to stop the key man superstar engineer.

A DevOps culture is one where configuration and tooling is open and available for engineers to use in a smooth and simple way.
