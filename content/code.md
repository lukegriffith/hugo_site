# Opensource Contributions 

## cChoco/cChocoFeature 
At work we had a need to set chocolatey features via DSC so we could roll out configuration changes to our workstation clients. I developed this resource in our branched version of cChoco and worked with Chocolatey Software to merge our newly developed resource back in to the community project.

## ShowTruthTable 
During the first year of university I came across a number of logic problems in revision and exams, to give me an easy way to check my work and improve my Python I created a dynamic truth table generator that outputs to the console the result of the python expresson entered into a REPL loop.
