## Gitlab Terraform Provider

I worked on the Gitlab provider to add the remote mirrors api, as a terraform resource. This creates a mirror object that syncs to a remote git repository.

To achieve this I had to update the upstream go library, using the [gitlab API documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/repository_mirroring.html). Once merged and released created I added changes to the Terraform provider.
