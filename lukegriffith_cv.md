# University

## Computing BSc @ Birkbeck

Expected graduation is 2020, the course has helped me understand a lot of the 
history and fundamentals of computing technologies, but has also given me a 
broader understanding of the industry. My time at Birkbeck so far has taught me 
to be a better developer, understanding more of the terminology and concepts 
that underpin the technology I use on a daily basis.

Here is a subset of the modules I've found most interesting:

- Software Programming.
- Algorithm Design.
- Computer organisation and system architecture
- Machine learning concepts.
